While Zbigniew Brzezinski's article in The American Interest titled "Towards a Global Realignment" has largely been ignored by the media, it shows that powerful members of the policymaking establishment no longer believe that Washington will prevail in its quest to extent US hegemony across the Middle East and Asia.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a08985c27892dc402872d09aa14f1ef/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.counterpunch.org%2Fwp-content%2Fdropzone%2F2016%2F08%2FScreen-Shot-2016-08-24-at-8.03.56-PM.png"></article>]]></description>
