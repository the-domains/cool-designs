  For the self-described "most transparent administration ever" it appears
  keeping the lies straight is becoming harder and harder. Having slammed the
  press, Donald Trump, and anyone who dare mention the "lack of logic" in paying
  a $400 million ransom for 4 Iran hostages, WSJ reports that Treasury officials
  have confirmed that Obama lied and in fact, the tightly scripted exchange of
  cash was specifically timed to the release of several American prisoners held
  in Iran.
