  The Western Press keeps repeating the same message - by leaving the European
  Union, the British have isolated themselves from the rest of the world, and
  will have to deal with terrible economic consequences. And yet, the fall in
  the Pound could be an advantage within the Commonwealth, which is a far
  greater family than the Union, and present on all six continents.
