  Money-substitutes, bank notes and bank deposits, were originally backed by
  physical silver, and were switched in favour of gold-backed money-substitutes
  over the last two centuries. It was a process that happened first in England,
  starting with Isaac Newton's declaration in 1717 that silver would be
  exchanged at the Royal Mint in the ratio of fifteen and a half ounces to one
  of gold.
