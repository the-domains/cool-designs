  The FBI is worried: foreign hackers have broken into two state election
  databases. The Department of Homeland Security is worried: the nation's voting
  system needs greater protection against cyberattacks. I, on the other hand, am
  not overly worried: after all, the voting booths have already been hacked by a
  political elite comprised of Republicans and Democrats who are determined to
  retain power at all costs.
