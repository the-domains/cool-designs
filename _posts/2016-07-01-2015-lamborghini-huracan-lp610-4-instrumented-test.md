  You may know the Nardò Ring as the 7.8-mile asphalt track where the world's
  automakers take their top-speed vacations. A traffic-free circular autobahn in
  the heel of Italy's boot, the Porsche-owned test track is banked such that you
  can take your hands off any car's steering wheel at 149 mph in the outer lane.
