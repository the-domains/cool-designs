  There is the greatest conspiracy of all time. The corrupt politicians have
  completely corrupted mainstream media. They even organized the overthrow at
  Fox News because that was the only station they could not take over.
  Everything from CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and countless newspapers are all out for a
  coronation of Hillary at the complete expense of the free press.
