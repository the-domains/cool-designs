  Editor's note: This is a guest post from Creek Stewart of Willow Haven
  Outdoor. As a Survival and Preparedness instructor, I take my line of work
  very seriously-sometimes too seriously. Occasionally, though, I like to take
  on survival projects that are just downright fun. This article highlights one
  of those projects.
