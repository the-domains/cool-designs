  The main architect of Washington's plan to rule the world has abandoned the
  scheme and called for the forging of ties with Russia and China. While
  Zbigniew Brzezinski's article in The American Interest titled "Towards a
  Global Realignment" has largely been ignored by the media, it shows that
  powerful members of the policymaking establishment no longer believe that
  Washington will prevail in its quest to extent US hegemony across the Middle
  East and Asia.
